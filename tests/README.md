# Testing


## Test standard plugin operations
Run `npm run test` to run unit tests and output test HTML results.

HTML output results can be found in [./tests/runtime/results].
JS template functions can be found in [./tests/runtime/functions].





## Create your own tests
You can create your own tests by using any of the Handlebars templates and helpers in the `tests/src` directory, or using your own Handlebars templates/helpers.



### Creating templates/helpers
1. Create a `tests/src/dev` directory
2. Create templates with the `.hbs` extension in this directory
3. Create helpers by writing a JS module in this directory



### Test compiler
1. Create a `tests/compiler/dev.test.ts` (Example is found in [./tests/compiler/dev.sample.test.ts])
2. Run `npm run testcompiler-dev`



### Test runtime
- To test runtime, files used here are dependent on the files generated by `npm run testcompiler-dev`. Make sure you have written the appropriate tests in `tests/compiler/dev.test.ts` that match the runtime tests. After doing so, to run test:
    1. Create a `tests/runtime/dev.test.ts` (Example is found in [./tests/runtime/dev.sample.test.ts])
    2. Run `npm run testcompiler-dev` (Optional, but necessary to run at least once)
    3. Run `npm run testruntime-dev`
- You can also run `npm run test-dev` to test both the compiler and runtime together.
- Generated JS functions can be found in the `tests/runtime/functions/dev` directory
- HTML output results can be found in the `tests/runtime/results/dev` directory
